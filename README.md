# Python Text Adventure API
This aims to provide resources to create an awesome text adventure quickly.
The textadventure package has the essentials to create a game. 

## Before Installing
If you are on windows and are not using gitbash or a unix compatable terminal, you will not get the full experience. If you still aren't convinved to switch to a unix like shell, it is recommended to install colorama so the colors work. This along with the curses library is completely optional to install.

If you are using a unix like terminal, if you install curses you will be able to get a full screen experience with shortcuts like CTRL+Right Arrow and other emac shortcuts.
## Prerequisites
Python 3.5 or Greater

Colorama (recommended especially if not using unix like shell)

curses (if using unix like shell)
## Installing
```
\# optional:
pip3 install colorama
pip3 install curses

\#cloning
git clone https://github.com/retrodaredevil/python-text-adventure-api
```
## Running
```
python3.5 main.py
\# or
python3.5 main.py --simple
```

## For people actually wanting to Utilize this
As for usability, I tried to document the code as best a I could, but I believe without a tutorial
it would be quite hard to get started. I plan to make one in the future but otherwise, feel free to look through the ninjagame package or ask me questions.

I will hopefully be adding more documentation in the future.

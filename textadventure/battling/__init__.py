"""
All stuff for battling is kept in a separate package because I feel that it needs to be separated since we don't
    need things in the textadventure package to depend on battling
(Nothing in the textadventure package should import anything from battling)
This package was created to support the ninjagame so the battles may not fit your game's needs which is one reason why \
    it is kept separate from the files in the textadventure root

This is my text adventure api project.
The textadventure package has the essentials to create a game. 

As for usability, I tried to document the code as best a I could, but I believe without a tutorial
it would be quite hard to get started.

I will hopefully be adding more documentation in the future.

To run the game that I am working on right now, make sure you have python 3.6 and then use 'main.py'

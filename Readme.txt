This is my text adventure api project.
The textadventure package has the essentials to create a game. 

Note that, as of right now, running main.py is hardcoded to use TextPrinterOutput which uses the curses library,
which only works on unix based systems.

As for usability, I tried to document the code as best a I could, but I believe without a tutorial
it would be quite hard to get started. I plan to make one in the future but otherwise, feel free to look through
the ninjagame package or ask me questions.

I will hopefully be adding more documentation in the future.

To run the game that I am working on right now, make sure you have python 3.6 and then use 'main.py'
If you are on windows, please install the colorama module
